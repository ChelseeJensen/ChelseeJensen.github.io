                <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
                <h4>Apple</h4>

                    This website does a really good job using white space. They leave space between graphics and text.
                    On the graphics there is white space that makes the website look clean and visually pleasing.

                <h3>Similarity</h3>
                <h4>Southwest</h4>
                <a class="websitelink" href="https://www.southwest.com" target="_blank">southwest.com</a><br>

                <p>
                    Southwest has done a great job using the law of similarity. Under their main graphics (which
                    alternate) they have small rectangles, all the same size. These rectangles are all related to
                    flights. But each option has a small image next to it in different colors. The options directly
                    relating to choosing a flight have light blue images. Options related to flights that have already
                    been booked have a yellow image next to them. It makes it easy to distinguish which options apply to
                    your needs.

            <div>
                <h3>Fitt's Law</h3>
                <h4>Papa John's</h4>
                <a class="websitelink" href="https://www.papajohns.com" target="_blank">papajohns.com</a><br>
                <img class="screenshot" src="/lesson-2/papajohns.jpg" alt="Papa John's Screenshot">
                <p>
                    When I first navigated to Papa John's mobile website the first thing I noticed is the large images
                    of pizzas. It's easy to scroll through different options, and right underneath each option is a
                    large "Order Now" button. These fall right at my fingertips on a mobile device making it very easy
                    to make a selection. Other items that aren't commonly ordered are smaller and closer to the top of
                    the mobile webpage. I may be lazy, but it was nice to find all the information I wanted without
                    having to adjust my hand placement on my phone.
