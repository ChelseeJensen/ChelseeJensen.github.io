                <h3>Description of Target Audience</h3>
                <p>The target audience for this website are people living in southeast Idaho who want to keep track of the weather and other community events. They are family and outdoor loving people, ages 14 to 65. Those of working age are in the income range of 30 to 90K. They enjoy being physically active and they enjoy being active within the community.</p>
                <p>Forecasts are expected to be accurate based on their location. This website will be used to plan attire for the day (no mom wants to send her kid to school in shorts when it's only supposed to be 30 degrees F outside.). It will also be used to plan outdoor activities like hiking, swimming, outdoor movie nights, barbeques, water parties, and on and on. </p>
                <p>They will visit this website from home, work, or while outside enjoying the beautiful scenery. Mobile phones, tablets, laptops and desktops can all be expected to be used to access this site.</p>

                <h3>Two Personas</h3>
                <p>Michael is a 36 year old father of 5. He enjoys hunting, fishing and camping. He also enjoys spending time with his family outside so they go swimming or have outdoor movie nights as frequently as weather and time permits. He likes to check the weather so he can plan fun family outings ahead of time. He will often check the weather in the mornings before his kids head off to school, to be sure they are dressed appropriately for the day. He often uses his laptop while at work to check the weather, or his mobile phone while he is at home.</p>
                <p>Linda is a 62 year old grandmother. She enjoys throwing lavish parties or her grandchildren. She checks the weather frequently to be sure her parties won't be ruined by poor weather. She and her retired husband also enjoy taking walks on nature paths. She checks the weather before each outing to see if they will need jackets and hats or sunscreen and shorts. She likes to use her desktop computer to check the weather.</p>
